# About ℹ️
This is a first test of the composite pattern in Groovy.  
It displays the different building blocks of phrases in Mandarin.

## What's Groovy? ☕️
[Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform.  
It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform.

## Run it 🏃🏻
Once Groovy installed, open the CLI in the directory and type this:  

```bash
groovy Main.groovy
```

The result should be:

```
• Caldeira (Pò huǒ shān kǒu, 破火山口)
	• Cassé (Pò, 破)
	• Cratère (Huǒ shān kǒu, 火山口)
		• Volcan (Huǒ shān, 火山)
			• Feu (Huǒ, 火)
			• Montagne (Shān, 山)
		• Bouche (Kǒu, 口)
```
